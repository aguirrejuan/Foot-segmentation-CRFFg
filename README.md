# Foot-segmentation-CRFFg

Repository for the paper **Foot Segmentation for Regional Analgesia Monitoring using Convolutional RFF and Layer-Wise Weighted CAM Interpretability**


Due to the exhaustive analysis of all the models and layers, to get the results shown on the paper we divided the code into the next notebooks:

* [1-Training.ipynb](1-Training.ipynb): Training of all models. 
* [2-Test.ipynb](2-Training.ipynb):  Metrics on the test partition.
* [3-CAMs_generation.ipynb](3-CAMs_generation.ipynb): Generation of the CAMs for all the interest layers.
* [4-CAMs_generation_metrics.ipynb](4-CAMs_generation_metrics.ipynb): Generation of the results for the proposed metrics.
* [5-CAMs_metrics_analysis.ipynb](5-CAMs_metrics_analysis.ipynb): Plots of the resulting metrics proposed.
